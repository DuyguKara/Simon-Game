# Simon-Game
This is mini website game.

I prepared a game with the JavaScript knowledge I learned in this project. I used the jQuery library while writing the code. To explain the game simply, the game randomly shows one of 4 squares and the user has to select that square. As the game progresses, the number of squares increases and with each new level the user must select the squares in the correct order from the beginning. If he fails, the game is over.

I added the necessary events when starting the game and for the player to play. I wrote a function to randomly select the frames in the game. Every time the player clicks, the selections are saved in their own array. I wrote another function that checks if these choices are correct. In this function, if the selections are correct and the user has made the expected number of clicks, the game will continue. If there is a mistake, the game is over. I also added a function to restart the game. Finally, I have functions for sound and animations. I also enriched the project by adding jQuery animations.
